        to help prevent unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of your Personal
        Data.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        While we seek to protect your information to ensure that it is kept
        confidential, we cannot guarantee the security of any information. You
        should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting

        Therefore, we encourage you to exercise discretion regarding the

        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        When you visit our App or access our Services, we use cookies, pixels,
        beacons, local storage, and similar technologies ("
        <strong>Tracking Technologies</strong>
        "). These allow us to automatically collect information about you, your
        device, and your online behavior, in order to enhance your navigation in
        our App, improve our Service's performance, perform analytics, customize
        your experience and offer you, for example, tailored content and
        advertisements that better correspond with your interests.&nbsp;

          </strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        When you use or access our Services, we use the following categories of
        Tracking Technologies:&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        (a) Strictly Necessary Tracking Technologies: these Tracking
        Technologies are automatically placed on your computer or device when
        you access our Services or take certain actions on our App. These
        Tracking Technologies are essential to enable you to navigate around and
        use the features of our Services. We do not need to obtain your consent
        in order to use these Tracking Technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        (b) Tracking and Advertising Tracking Technologies: these Tracking
        Technologies collect information about your browsing habits in order to
        make advertising more relevant to you and your interests. They are also
        used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as
        help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign. The Tracking
        Technologies remember the websites you visit and that information is
        shared with other parties such as advertisers and/or publishers.
        Publishers, advertisers, and third-party ad networks may also utilize
        Tracking Technologies or similar technologies to deliver ads and monitor
        the performance of such ads. The collection of information through
        Tracking Technologies by such third parties will be governed by their
        own privacy policies/cookies policies and principles, which Sovryn does
        not control.
      </p>
      <p>
        (c) Functionality Tracking Technologies: these Tracking Technologies
        allow our Services to remember choices you make (such as your language)
        and provide enhanced and personalized features. For example, these
        Tracking Technologies are used for authentication (to remember when you
        are logged in) and support other features of our Services;&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        (d) Performance Tracking Technologies: these Tracking Technologies
        collect information about your online activity (for example the duration
        of your visit to our Services), including behavioral data and content
        engagement metrics. These Tracking Technologies are used for analytics,
        research, and performing statistics (based on aggregated
        information).&nbsp;

        We store Tracking Technologies on your device when you visit or access
        our Services (for example, when you are visiting our website) &ndash;

        Tracking Technologies are stored by other third parties (for example,
        our analytics service providers, business partners, and advertisers),
        who run content on our Services &ndash; these are called "Third Party
        Tracking Technologies". Both types of Tracking Technologies may be
        stored either for the duration of your visit to our Services or repeat
        visits.
