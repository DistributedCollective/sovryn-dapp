      Welcome to the Sovryn app (www.sovryn.app), a website-hosted user
      interface (the
      <strong>"App"</strong>) developed by the Sovryn Community ("
      <strong>Sovryn</strong>
      ",
      <strong>&ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;our&rdquo;, or &ldquo;us&rdquo;</strong>
      ). The App provides information and access to the Sovryn Network, a
      platform for lending, borrowing, and trading crypto currencies (the
      &ldquo;
      <strong>Platform</strong>
      &rdquo;).&nbsp;The Platform is solely owned and fully controlled by an
      on-chain fully decentralized, community governed protocol deployed on the
      RSK blockchain (a Bitcoin side chain) (the
      <strong>&ldquo;Protocol&rdquo;,</strong>
      the "<strong>DAO</strong>
      ").&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      These Terms of Use and any terms and conditions incorporated herein by
      reference (collectively, the
      <strong>&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;</strong>) govern your access and use of the
      App. You ("
      <strong>User</strong>" or "<strong>You</strong>
      ") must read the Terms carefully. By accessing or using our App, you agree
      that you have read, understood, and agreed to these Terms. If you do not
      agree to these Terms, you must not use our App.&nbsp;

    <p>
      When using or accessing our App, you will also be subject to our Privacy

      The DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization, in which each staker

      It is important to understand that neither we nor any affiliated entity is
      a party to any transaction on the blockchain networks underlying the
      Protocol. We do not have possession, custody, or control over any
      cryptoassets appearing on the App or the Platform, and we do not have
      possession, custody, or control over any user's funds. Further, we do not
      store, send, or receive any cryptoassets. When you interact with any of
      the Protocol's smart contracts, you retain control over your cryptoassets
      at all times. We are not intermediaries, agents, advisors, or custodians,
      and we do not have a fiduciary relationship or obligation to you regarding
      any other decisions or activities that you affect when using the App. You
      acknowledge that we, for the avoidance of doubt, do not have any
      information regarding any users, users&rsquo; identities, or services
      beyond what is available or obtainable publicly via the blockchain. We are
      not responsible for any activities you engage in when using the App, and
      you should understand the risks associated with cryptoassets, blockchain
      technology, the App and the Platform. All community contributors to the
      ecosystem around the Protocol are independent of us, and we will not have

      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
      The Platform consists of various features and services, allowing users:
      (i) Bitcoin lending, borrowing, and margin trading from automatic lending
      pools; (ii) spot exchange between crypto currencies tokens; (iii) FastBTC
      relay, allowing almost instant bi-directionally exchange between Bitcoin
      and RBTC; (iv) token bridge between RSK, Ethereum and BSC; (v) perpetual
      swaps; (vi) purchase, sell, trade, of Bitcoin-backed USD-pegged
      stablecoin; (vii) SOV staking for fee sharing, voting power, platform
      rewards, and airdrops.
    </p>
    <br />

      <li>
        <strong className="text-xl">2.3.Deployed on RSK blockchain</strong>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
      The Platform is deployed on the RSK blockchain software and network. The
      RSK blockchain software and network is open source, which means that
      anyone can use, utilize, and build on top of it. Using the App to access
      the Platform, you acknowledge and agree (i) that we are not responsible
      for the operation of the blockchain-based software and network underlying
      the Protocol; (ii) that there exists no guarantee of the functionality,
      security, or availability of that software and network; and (iii) that the
      underlying blockchain-based network is subject to sudden changes in
      operating rules, such as those commonly referred to as "forks".&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      The native token of RSK is RBTC, an exact 1:1 BTC peg. When you transfer
      bitcoin into RSK, your bitcoin is locked and the equivalent amount is
      released as RBTC on RSK, which gives you access to the Platform's features
      and services. In addition, all fees are paid in RBTC, so you don't need a
      separate asset just for transaction fees.&nbsp;

      <li>
        <strong className="text-xl">2.4.RSK Exchange Protocol</strong>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
      The Platform enables Users to trade, lend and borrow on an external
      exchange protocol, RSK ("
      <strong>Exchange</strong>
      <strong>Protocol</strong>
      "). When using the Exchange Protocol, you hereby agree to any and all
      acknowledgments, representations, and warranties described in these Terms
      and any other related document. Additionally, you (i) acknowledge that
      transactions on the Platform and the Exchange Protocol are subject to
      fees; (ii) represent and warrant that you shall pay any applicable fees in
      accordance with these Terms and any other relevant document; (iii)
      represent and warrant that you understand that there are considerable
      risks involved in the activities performed on the Exchange Protocol,
      including, without limitation, risks relating to the fluctuations of the
      staked funds, liquidity, operational, regulatory and technical risks. You
      shall carefully consider and exercise clear judgment to evaluate your
      financial situation and the aforesaid risks to make any decision on using
      the Exchange Protocol, as well as any other portion of our Platform, and
      you shall be responsible for all losses arising therefrom; and (iv) the
      Exchange Protocol is not operated by Sovryn and Sovryn has no
      responsibility and liability with respect to your use of the Exchange
      Protocol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that operators of the Exchange Protocol may apply additional
      terms to your access and use of the Exchange Protocol.&nbsp;

    <p>
      By using the App and the Platform, you acknowledge that your public key

    <p>
      The private key associated with the wallet address from which you transfer
      cryptoassets, or the private key associated, is the only private key that
      can control the cryptoassets you transfer into the smart contracts. You
      alone are responsible for securing your private keys. We do not have
      access to your private keys due to the non-custodial and decentralized
      nature of the technology.

      In order to use the Platform, you will be required to connect your web
      wallet ("
      <strong>Wallet</strong>
      "). Your trades and transactions on the Platform will be executed through
      funds held independently by you in your Wallet.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sovryn does not provide a Wallet of any kind and does not control your
      funds or your private keys to the Wallet. Additionally, we do not own or
      control the code or the underlying protocols for your Wallet, or the
      networks of the crypto assets in your Wallet, and we assume no
      responsibility for any losses or damages you may incur from using the
      Wallet, or purchasing, holding, staking or selling crypto assets,
      including loss or theft of access credentials, liquidity risks,
      operational or cyber risks or changes in protocol rules ("forks").&nbsp;

    <br />
    <p>
      Your use of the Platform and trading, lending, or borrowing of crypto
      assets may be subject to applicable taxes, levies, duties, or similar
      governmental assessments. It is your sole responsibility to determine
      whether, and to what extent, any taxes apply to any transfer and to
      withhold, collect, report and remit the correct amount of tax to the
      appropriate tax authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trading of crypto assets may also be subject to platform fees, developers'
      fees, RSK Exchange Protocol fees, and network fees (including gas and
      mining fees), for which you will be solely responsible. All fees will be
      automatically deducted from the smart contract. All fees are paid in RBTC,
      so you don't need a separate asset just for transaction fees.&nbsp;

        <strong className="text-xl">4.4.Risk Disclosure&nbsp;</strong>
      </li>

    <p>
      Transactions on the Protocol rely on smart contracts, cryptographic tokens
      generated by the smart contracts, and other nascent software,
      applications, and systems that interact with blockchain-based networks.
      These technologies are experimental, speculative, inherently risky, and
      subject to change. These risks include, without limitation:
    </p>
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
      <li>
        <em>Virtual platform risks:</em>
        including bugs, malfunctions, and cyberattacks.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Blockchain risks:</em>
        including changes to the applicable blockchain (e.g., forks), immutable
        so that recorded transactions on the blockchain must be treated as
        permanent and cannot be undone by us or anyone.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Lending risks</em>: losing any funds which have been loaned, in
        circumstances where a borrower in whose loan you have participated
        defaults, and the repayments cannot be collected automatically by smart
        contracts.&nbsp;
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>Regulatory risks:</em>
        the use of blockchain technology, decentralized organization, and
        decentralized finance services are mostly unregulated in most
        jurisdictions. Future regulations, therefore, may change significantly
        the possibility, conditions, fees, taxes, etc. of using the
        Platform.&nbsp;
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Malicious activities:</em>
        risks relating to the unauthorized or illegal activities that may occur
        on our Platform.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You acknowledge and agree that your use of the Platform involves those
      risks and Sovryn shall not have any liability for any losses incurred for
      such uses.
    </p>
    <p>
      You agree to the automated collection and disbursement of proceeds by
      smart contracts. You acknowledge and agree that all transactions accessed
      through the Platform will be automatically processed using one or more
      blockchain-based smart contracts. By engaging in transactions using the
      Platform, you acknowledge and consent to the automatic processing of all
      transactions in connection with using the Platform. You further
      acknowledge and agree that the applicable smart contract will dictate how
      the funds of a transaction and ownership of cryptoassets are distributed.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are solely responsible for the security of your Wallet. You understand
      and agree that you are solely responsible for maintaining the security of
      your Wallet. Any unauthorized access to your Wallet by third parties could
      result in the loss or theft of any cryptoasset, or any funds held in your
      account and any associated accounts. You understand and agree that we have
      no involvement, and you will not hold us responsible for managing and
      maintaining the security of your Wallet. You further understand and agree
      that we are not responsible, and you will not hold us accountable, for any
      unauthorized access to your Wallet.&nbsp;
