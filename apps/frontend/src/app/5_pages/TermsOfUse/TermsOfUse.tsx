        Welcome to the Sovryn app (www.sovryn.app), a website-hosted user
        interface (the
        <strong>"App"</strong>) developed by the Sovryn Community ("
        <strong>Sovryn</strong>

          &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;our&rdquo;, or &ldquo;us&rdquo;

        ). The App provides information and access to the Sovryn Network, a
        platform for lending, borrowing, and trading crypto currencies (the
        &ldquo;
        <strong>Platform</strong>
        &rdquo;).&nbsp;The Platform is solely owned and fully controlled by an
        on-chain fully decentralized, community governed protocol deployed on
        the RSK blockchain (a Bitcoin side chain) (the
        <strong>&ldquo;Protocol&rdquo;,</strong>
        the "<strong>DAO</strong>
        ").&nbsp;

      <p>
        These Terms of Use and any terms and conditions incorporated herein by
        reference (collectively, the
        <strong>&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;</strong>) govern your access and use of the
        App. You ("
        <strong>User</strong>" or "<strong>You</strong>

        agree that you have read, understood, and agreed to these Terms. If you
        do not agree to these Terms, you must not use our App.&nbsp;

        The DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization, in which each staker

        It is important to understand that neither we nor any affiliated entity
        is a party to any transaction on the blockchain networks underlying the
        Protocol. We do not have possession, custody, or control over any
        cryptoassets appearing on the App or the Platform, and we do not have
        possession, custody, or control over any user's funds. Further, we do
        not store, send, or receive any cryptoassets. When you interact with any
        of the Protocol's smart contracts, you retain control over your
        cryptoassets at all times. We are not intermediaries, agents, advisors,
        or custodians, and we do not have a fiduciary relationship or obligation
        to you regarding any other decisions or activities that you affect when
        using the App. You acknowledge that we, for the avoidance of doubt, do
        not have any information regarding any users, users&rsquo; identities,
        or services beyond what is available or obtainable publicly via the

        cryptoassets, blockchain technology, the App and the Platform. All
        community contributors to the ecosystem around the Protocol are

      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Platform consists of various features and services, allowing users:
        (i) Bitcoin lending, borrowing, and margin trading from automatic
        lending pools; (ii) spot exchange between crypto currencies tokens;
        (iii) FastBTC relay, allowing almost instant bi-directionally exchange
        between Bitcoin and RBTC; (iv) token bridge between RSK, Ethereum and
        BSC; (v) perpetual swaps; (vi) purchase, sell, trade, of Bitcoin-backed
        USD-pegged stablecoin; (vii) SOV staking for fee sharing, voting power,
        platform rewards, and airdrops.

          <strong className="text-xl">2.3.Deployed on RSK blockchain</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Platform is deployed on the RSK blockchain software and network. The
        RSK blockchain software and network is open source, which means that
        anyone can use, utilize, and build on top of it. Using the App to access
        the Platform, you acknowledge and agree (i) that we are not responsible
        for the operation of the blockchain-based software and network
        underlying the Protocol; (ii) that there exists no guarantee of the
        functionality, security, or availability of that software and network;
        and (iii) that the underlying blockchain-based network is subject to
        sudden changes in operating rules, such as those commonly referred to as
        "forks".&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        The native token of RSK is RBTC, an exact 1:1 BTC peg. When you transfer
        bitcoin into RSK, your bitcoin is locked and the equivalent amount is
        released as RBTC on RSK, which gives you access to the Platform's
        features and services. In addition, all fees are paid in RBTC, so you
        don't need a separate asset just for transaction fees.&nbsp;

      <p>
        The Platform enables Users to trade, lend and borrow on an external
        exchange protocol, RSK ("
        <strong>Exchange</strong>
        <strong>Protocol</strong>
        "). When using the Exchange Protocol, you hereby agree to any and all
        acknowledgments, representations, and warranties described in these
        Terms and any other related document. Additionally, you (i) acknowledge
        that transactions on the Platform and the Exchange Protocol are subject
        to fees; (ii) represent and warrant that you shall pay any applicable
        fees in accordance with these Terms and any other relevant document;
        (iii) represent and warrant that you understand that there are
        considerable risks involved in the activities performed on the Exchange
        Protocol, including, without limitation, risks relating to the
        fluctuations of the staked funds, liquidity, operational, regulatory and
        technical risks. You shall carefully consider and exercise clear
        judgment to evaluate your financial situation and the aforesaid risks to
        make any decision on using the Exchange Protocol, as well as any other
        portion of our Platform, and you shall be responsible for all losses
        arising therefrom; and (iv) the Exchange Protocol is not operated by
        Sovryn and Sovryn has no responsibility and liability with respect to
        your use of the Exchange Protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that operators of the Exchange Protocol may apply additional
        terms to your access and use of the Exchange Protocol.&nbsp;

      <p>
        The private key associated with the wallet address from which you
        transfer cryptoassets, or the private key associated, is the only
        private key that can control the cryptoassets you transfer into the
        smart contracts. You alone are responsible for securing your private
        keys. We do not have access to your private keys due to the
        non-custodial and decentralized nature of the technology.

        networks of the crypto assets in your Wallet, and we assume no
        responsibility for any losses or damages you may incur from using the

        Your use of the Platform and trading, lending, or borrowing of crypto
        assets may be subject to applicable taxes, levies, duties, or similar
        governmental assessments. It is your sole responsibility to determine
        whether, and to what extent, any taxes apply to any transfer and to
        withhold, collect, report and remit the correct amount of tax to the
        appropriate tax authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trading of crypto assets may also be subject to platform fees,
        developers' fees, RSK Exchange Protocol fees, and network fees
        (including gas and mining fees), for which you will be solely
        responsible. All fees will be automatically deducted from the smart
        contract. All fees are paid in RBTC, so you don't need a separate asset
        just for transaction fees.&nbsp;

        Transactions on the Protocol rely on smart contracts, cryptographic
        tokens generated by the smart contracts, and other nascent software,
        applications, and systems that interact with blockchain-based networks.
        These technologies are experimental, speculative, inherently risky, and
        subject to change. These risks include, without limitation:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>
          <em>Virtual platform risks:</em>
          including bugs, malfunctions, and cyberattacks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Blockchain risks:</em>
          including changes to the applicable blockchain (e.g., forks),
          immutable so that recorded transactions on the blockchain must be
          treated as permanent and cannot be undone by us or anyone.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Lending risks</em>: losing any funds which have been loaned, in
          circumstances where a borrower in whose loan you have participated
          defaults, and the repayments cannot be collected automatically by
          smart contracts.&nbsp;
        </li>

        <li>
          <em>Regulatory risks:</em>
          the use of blockchain technology, decentralized organization, and
          decentralized finance services are mostly unregulated in most
          jurisdictions. Future regulations, therefore, may change significantly
          the possibility, conditions, fees, taxes, etc. of using the
          Platform.&nbsp;
